# Secure Messaging Application

## Overview
The Secure Messaging Application is designed to provide a secure platform for digital communications. It encrypts messages using advanced encryption and steganographic techniques, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential between the sender and the recipient. This project is built with a focus on privacy and security, making it suitable for both personal and professional use.

## Key Features
- **Encryption**: Messages are encrypted using steganography, hiding them within images or audio files without altering the perception of the media.

- **User Authentication**: Robust authentication system to manage user access and secure user data.
- **Friendship Management**: Users can manage their contacts within the app, adding and maintaining secure connections.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- FastApi for the backend
- React for the frontend
- MySQL for the database
- Libraries: PyCrypto for encryption, PIL for image handling, and Pydub for audio processing.
